Chapter 3: The Hidden Gateway

The morning fog rolled thick across the valley, obscuring the ancient stones that Sarah had been studying for weeks. She pulled her jacket tighter around her shoulders, squinting through the mist at her research notes. Something about the markings didn't add up – they seemed to shift and change every time she looked away.

Professor Chen had warned her about this site. "There's more to those ruins than meets the eye," he'd said, tapping his weathered notebook meaningfully. Now, standing here alone in the pre-dawn light, Sarah understood what he meant.

The symbols pulsed with a faint blue glow, barely visible through the fog. She reached out, her fingers trembling as they traced the worn edges of the nearest stone. The surface felt warm despite the chilly morning air, and beneath her touch, the ancient runes began to sing.

Sarah stepped back, her heart pounding. After three years of archaeological research, she'd finally found it – the gateway that the legends spoke of. Now she just had to decide whether to open it.

The fog continued to swirl, waiting for her choice.
